Todos if I ever decide to continue this project:
- Fix "not counting in background" issue
- Add more interactions about 80k 200k 700k goals
- Fix the minus cookies darkening issue toggling and not untoggling if used in same tick
- Fix visuals not sticking out of their lines
- Minor issues which I need to play to notice
